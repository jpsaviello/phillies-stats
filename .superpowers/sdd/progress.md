# Progress Ledger: player-game-log

Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-07-player-game-log.md
Base: 860dd54

Task 1: complete (uncommitted working-tree changes, review clean)
Task 2: complete (uncommitted working-tree changes, review clean)
  - Note: fixed a Task-1 bug found during verification -- GameLogOpponent shape (types/mlb.ts) was nested {team:{id,name}}, live API returns flat {id,name}. Verified via grep, only consumer updated (GameLogModal.tsx). Reviewer confirmed fix is correct and complete.
  - Minor carried to Task 3: GameLogModal.tsx colSpan={9} on empty-state row is hitting-only (9 cols); pitching has 8 cols. Inert until Task 3 wires group="pitching". Fix as part of Task 3.
Task 3: complete (uncommitted working-tree changes, review clean -- colSpan fix verified correct: 9 for hitting, 8 for pitching)
All tasks complete.
Final whole-branch review: Ready to merge = Yes. No Critical/Important issues; 5 Minor notes (all accepted, none blocking).
# Progress Ledger: game-log-trends

Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-game-log-trends.md
Base: 08fb428

Task 1: complete (uncommitted working-tree changes; fetchGameLog now returns full season chronological, modal derives last-10, CLAUDE.md updated)
Task 2: complete (src/utils/trends.ts; math spot-checked against live API — final ERA matches season ERA 5.87 for Nola, cum HR matches season total 11 for Bohm)
Task 3: complete (src/components/TrendChart.tsx; palette validated via dataviz skill, all checks pass)
Task 4: complete (toggle + chart wired into GameLogModal; verified end-to-end with webapp-testing, screenshots reviewed, no console errors)
  - Bug found & fixed during visual review: niceTicks could stop below the data max, clipping the line outside the plot (seen on a 6.52 ERA vs 5.00 top tick). Loop now extends until top tick >= max; re-verified.
  - Polish from visual review: partial first-month label dropped when it crowds the next ("Mar"/"Apr" collision); tooltip text given a white halo (paintOrder=stroke) so the line can't strike through it.
All tasks complete.
