Base: 860dd54

Task 1: complete (uncommitted working-tree changes, review clean)
Task 2: complete (uncommitted working-tree changes, review clean)
  - Note: fixed a Task-1 bug found during verification -- GameLogOpponent shape (types/mlb.ts) was nested {team:{id,name}}, live API returns flat {id,name}. Verified via grep, only consumer updated (GameLogModal.tsx). Reviewer confirmed fix is correct and complete.
  - Minor carried to Task 3: GameLogModal.tsx colSpan={9} on empty-state row is hitting-only (9 cols); pitching has 8 cols. Inert until Task 3 wires group="pitching". Fix as part of Task 3.
Task 3: complete (uncommitted working-tree changes, review clean -- colSpan fix verified correct: 9 for hitting, 8 for pitching)
All tasks complete.
Final whole-branch review: Ready to merge = Yes. No Critical/Important issues; 5 Minor notes (all accepted, none blocking).
